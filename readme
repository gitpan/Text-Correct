NAME
    Text::Correct - Module for implementing text wrapping

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::Correct qw( wrap $MAX_LEN $PARA );
        $MAX_LEN = 60;  # 60 columns of text
        $PARA = 0;      # condense newlines
        print wrap($firstline_lead, $otherline_lead, @text);

        use Text::Correct qw( wrap );
        wrap("\t", "", $speech);  # "regular" paragraph formatting    

DESCRIPTION
    This module is sort of a different approach to text wrapping
    than taken in Text::Wrap. This module allows for condensing of
    newlines, to format long blocks of text into one, or (as the
    default) to format paragraphs (these are blocks of text
    separated by two or more newlines) individually.

  Functions

    wrap(INITAL_LEAD, SUBSEQUENT_LEAD, TEXT)
        The first argument is the lead to be placed in front of the
        first line; the second is the lead to be placed in front of
        each subsequent line. Following that is a list of lines of
        text. The function is not exported by default.

    expand(TEXT)
        This converts tabs to NULL characters. This function is used
        internally, but is governed by the $TAB variable.

    unexpand(TEXT)
        This converts series of NULL characters to tabs. This
        function is used internally, but is governed by the $TAB
        variable.

  Variables

    $Text::Correct::MAX_LEN
        The number of characters of text (excluding a newline) per
        line.

    $Text::Correct::PARA
        A boolean deciding whether or not to invoke paragraph mode.
        If paragraph mode is on, text will be split up into blocks
        separated by two or more newlines. If it is off, the text
        will be treated as a single block, which means the text is
        condensed into one paragraph.

    $Text::Correct::TAB
        This holds the number of spaces a tab is to represent. It
        defaults to 8, and is used in determining the length of a
        string with tabs in it.

COMING SOON
    I plan to reimplement this module using formline().

BUGS
    If text contains NULL characters, expand() and unexpand() will
    not work properly. Fix: don't use NULL characters. ;)
